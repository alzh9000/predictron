You will need to use a TRONLink wallet and connect it to the TRONLink Nile testnet. Go to [TRON documenation](https://developers.tron.network/docs/build-a-web3-app#install) and follow the instructions to install the TRONLink extension. Then, create a wallet on TRONLink and connect your wallet to the Nile testnet, so you can use our website with TRON.
